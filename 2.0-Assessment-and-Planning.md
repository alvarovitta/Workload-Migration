# Assessment and Planning - draft

After you know what needs to be migrated, you must evaluate the processes and workloads, and determine how to migrate it to Azure. This is known as the second stage of the workload migration process and that is the assessment and planning stage.


This stage is critical because it will help drive a strong plan and help you prioritize the mission critical apps that you wish to move to the cloud. Without a strong plan, risks can include a complex and time-consuming process compounded by a lack of relevant skills, loss of control by moving computer resources off-premises, concerns about bandwidth, and unexpected costs. 

Microsoft has a tool that will help ease this risk. This tool is Azure Migrate. With the Azure Migrate service you can assesses on-premises workloads for migration to Azure. The service assesses the migration suitability of on-premises machines, performance-based sizing, and provides cost estimations for running your on-premises machines in Azure. If you're contemplating lift-and-shift migrations, or are in the early assessment stages of migration, this service is for you.

The following diagram illustrates the nuts and bolts of Azure Migrate:

## Guidance
Use the following guidance in assessing and planning your workloads to Azure.

- Follow the best practice framework for evaluating an application for cloud migration below:

<br/>

- When you use Azure Migrate to conduct an assessment of your virtual machines, we recommend that you keep machines with interdependencies within the same project and assessment. If for example, you are using vCenter Server, make sure that dependent machines are in the same folder, datacenter, or cluster for the assessment. 

- Follow this guidance to customise the default [assessment properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-modify-assessment#edit-assessment-properties) in Azure migrate as per your requirements



## Preparation

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:Â 

- Review and understand the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-scale-assessment#prerequisites) on what you need to be aware of prior to the assessment
- Review the [port requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-overview#what-are-the-port-requirements) for Azure Migrate
- [Plan your migration projects and discoveries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-scale-assessment#plan-your-migration-projects-and-discoveries)


## Procedure 

- Use [Azure Migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-scale-assessment#discover-on-premises-environment) to start the discovery and assessment of your on-premises virtual machines
