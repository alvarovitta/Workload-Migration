# Target Preparation and Migration - draft

The final stage in this process is the target preparation and migration stage. 

This stage requires you to take the deep discovery and assessment that was completed in the last two stages and identify the on-premises machines that are suitable for a lift-and-shift migration. These are the VMs that don't require any changes to apps running on them, and can be migrated as is.

Microsoft can ease this for you with Azure Site Recovery. With Site Recovery, you can do the following:

  - **Migrate from on-premises to Azure**: You can migrate on-premises VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers to Azure. To do this, you complete almost the same steps as you would for full disaster recovery. You simply don't fail machines back from Azure to the on-premises site.

  - **Migrate within Azure Regions**: You can migrate Azure VMs from one Azure region to another. After the migration is complete, you can configure disaster recovery for the Azure VMs now in the secondary region to which you migrated.

  - **Migrate AWS to Azure**: You can migrate AWS instances to Azure VMs. Site Recovery treats AWS instances as physical servers for for migration purposes.

## Guidance

  - Review the [Assessment readiness dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/how-to-get-migration-tool#review-suggested-migration-methods) created by Azure Migrate to help you identify which workloads you can move to Azure.

  - If there are workloads that require changes prior to moving to Azure, we recommend that you address those changes then re-run the assessment again to ensure that the workloads are compatible and ready to move over to Azure.

  - If you want to migrate on-premises databases such a SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle to Azure, this may require you to migrate a specific app rather than an entire VM. If that is the case, we recommend the [Azure Database Migration service](https://azure.microsoft.com/campaigns/database-migration/) to seamlessly migrate your databases to Azure.

## Preparation

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:Â 

  - Review and understand the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-solution-provider/migration/on-premises-to-azure-csp/asr-setup-guide#prerequisites) for Azure Site Recovery
