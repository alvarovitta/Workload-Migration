# Discovery and Rationalization

When you consider migrating your on-premises workloads to the cloud, the first stage in this process is the discovery and rationalization stage.

## Preparation

Ask yourself the following questions:

- Why are you going to the cloud? 
- What specific benefits or outcomes do you want to achieve by adopting cloud? Are you looking to reduce IT costs, reduce risk, drive - business growth, enable IT scalability?
- What do these potential benefits mean for yours department and/or business? Are you looking for more productivity, ability to focus on core competencies, better citizen experiences, agility, innovation?
- How ready is your department to move to the cloud? Do you need to train staff in new skills, address fear of job loss, adjust ITIL operational support processes?
- What are the compliance considerations? For example, PCI, HIPAA, Protected B, etc.

## Guidance

Use this section as guidance on what steps you will need to understake to kick start the discovery and rationale phase of migrating your on-premise workloads to Azure.

- Define your cloud adoption and migration approach. Use the following 3-pronged approach:

   - Business (Top-Down): focus on business modernization initiatives and then identify how a workload will be transformed, the business value of transforming this is strategic and evaluative
   - Technical (Bottom-Up): focus on being strategic and evaluative in identifying the set of workloads to work with. A more tactical, more cost effective, deep dive analysis is required.  Understand the inter-dependencies and challenges in migrating your workloads.
   - Opportunistic â€“ identify how you wish to evolve your applications in azure as a part of a larger project and for convenience
