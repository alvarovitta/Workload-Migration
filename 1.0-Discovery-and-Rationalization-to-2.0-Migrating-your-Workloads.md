# Discovery and Rationalization

When you consider migrating your on-premises workloads to the cloud, the first stage in this process is the discovery and rationalization stage.

## Preparation

Ask yourself the following questions:

- Why are you going to the cloud? 
- What specific benefits or outcomes do you want to achieve by adopting cloud? Are you looking to reduce IT costs, reduce risk, drive - business growth, enable IT scalability?
- What do these potential benefits mean for the department or business? Are you looking for more productivity, ability to focus on core competencies, better citizen experiences, agility, innovation?
- How ready is your department to move to the cloud? Do you need to train staff in new skills, address fear of job loss, adjust ITIL operational support processes?
- What are the compliance considerations? For example, PCI, HIPAA, Protected B, etc.
