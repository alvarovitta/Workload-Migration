# Discovery and Rationalization

When you consider migrating your on-premises workloads to the cloud, the first stage in this process is the discovery and rationalization stage.

Ask yourself the following questions:

- Why are you going to the cloud? 
- What specific benefits or outcomes do you want to achieve by adopting cloud? Are you looking to reduce IT costs, reduce risk, drive - business growth, enable IT scalability?
- What do these potential benefits mean for yours department and/or business? Are you looking for more productivity, ability to focus on core competencies, better citizen experiences, agility, innovation?
- How ready is your department to move to the cloud? Do you need to train staff in new skills, address fear of job loss, adjust ITIL operational support processes?
- What are the compliance considerations? For example, PCI, HIPAA, Protected B, etc.

## Guidance

Use this section as guidance on what steps you will need to understake to kick start the discovery and rationale phase of migrating your on-premise workloads to Azure. 


- Define your your strategic objectives and strategic outcomes. This will help you feed your lifecycle road map and/or program of change. For example:

    - **For strategic objectives**: think about the business drivers pushing you to the cloud and the capabilities that matters most to you in the cloud. 
    - **For strategic outcomes**: assign metrics or performance indicators to measure success so that you can quantify the results and map it to your strategic objectives

<br/>

- Define your cloud adoption and migration approach. Use the following 3-pronged approach:

     - **Business (Top-Down)**: focus on business modernization initiatives and then identify how a workload will be transformed, the business value of transforming this is strategic and evaluative
     - **Technical (Bottom-Up)**: focus on being strategic and evaluative in identifying the set of workloads to work with. A more tactical, more cost effective, deep dive analysis is required.  Understand the inter-dependencies and challenges in migrating your workloads.
     - **Opportunistic** â€“ identify how you wish to evolve your applications in azure as a part of a larger project and for convenience

<br/>

- Identify the opportunities for rationalization and consolidation. 

     - Categorize the workloads that are classified vs unclassified
     - Identify the workloads that offer similiar business capabilities to your lines of businesses. 
     - Identify the workloads that will be decommissioned due to applications reaching its end of life 
     - Identify the workloads that need to be modernized due to the pace of change of the business
